xbmc.addon.call-notifications
=============================

*Call Notifications* does what the name says:
On incoming phone calls XBMC will show a notification.

The idea and parts of code are based on XBMC Yac Listener developed by @doug.

Any feedback and contributions are welcome!

Features:
-----------------------------
 
 - Show Notification on incoming calls
 - Set Volume / Mute Volume / Pause Playback on incoming calls
 - Fully configurable through XBMC Gui


Client Support:
--------------------------------

 *  [Ncid](http://ncid.sourceforge.net/)  (Network Caller ID)

    Ncid seems to be the standard for unix based CallerID.
    It supports wide range of configurations.


What may be added?
-----------------------------

 * More Clients -> Ideas welcome
 * More Languages
 * CallLog
